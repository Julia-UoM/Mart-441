    <h2>A Game Memory</h2>
    <p>
      One of my strongest gaming memories is playing Minecraft with friends late at night.
      We built massive structures, explored caves, and slowly created a shared world.
      It felt less like a game and more like a digital place we lived in together.

  <!-- Reflection -->
  <section class="section light">
    <h2>How I See the World</h2>
    <p>
      I see the world as a system of interconnected stories. Games reflect that.
      They let us experiment with choices, consequences, and identities in a safe space.
      I think games can help us understand complex problems by letting us play with them.
