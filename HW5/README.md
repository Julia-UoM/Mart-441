<center><b>Generative AI Use & Reflection</b></center> <p>
I used generative AI to help structure an initial version of the story logic. The first output worked, but it felt slightly impersonal and overly complex for our purposes here. Revising the structure and rewriting parts of the code helped me better understand what each function was doing and how they connected. Ultimately, editing and simplifying the AI-generated structure was what helped the most. It gave me a starting framework that made the use of functions easier to grasp, especially because I initially struggled with how to structure them. Having the option to use generative AI to assist with generating the inital code has been an amazing resource and has helped me understand java script in a way that I previously have not been able to achieve.
